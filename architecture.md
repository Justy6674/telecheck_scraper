# TeleCheck - Production Architecture

## Platform Overview

**TeleCheck** (telecheck.com.au) is a production-ready SaaS platform providing real-time verification of Australian natural disaster zones for telehealth MBS exemptions. Healthcare practitioners can instantly verify if patients are located in government-declared disaster areas, removing the standard "established clinical relationship" requirement for telehealth services.

### Business Model
- **Free Tier**: Public postcode searches (100 requests/hour)
- **Professional Tier**: $149/month - 500 verifications, dashboard access, compliance notes
- **Enterprise Tier**: $399/month - High-volume APIs, practice management integration

### Current Implementation Status

#### âœ… **Completed Components**
- **Supabase Database**: Full PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies, real-time subscriptions
- **Authentication System**: Practice-focused registration with JWT tokens
- **Core Verification Engine**: Real-time postcode disaster lookup with MBS-compliant documentation
- **Medical UI/UX**: Healthcare-grade design system with accessibility compliance
- **Dashboard**: Real-time disaster monitoring, compliance tracking, usage analytics

#### ðŸš§ **In Development**
- **Government Data Integration**: Automated scraping from all Australian jurisdictions
- **Practice Management APIs**: Integration with Medical Director, Best Practice, Cliniko
- **AI Compliance Assistant**: Advanced note generation and policy guidance
- **Interactive Disaster Map**: Real-time visualization of declarations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack (Lovable.dev)
```typescript
// Component Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with medical design system
- Shadcn/ui components with healthcare variants
- React Query for server state management
- Supabase real-time subscriptions
```

### Backend Infrastructure (Supabase)
```sql
-- Core Database Schema
disaster_declarations (
  id, lga_code, disaster_type, severity_level,
  declaration_status, postcodes[], declaration_date,
  expiry_date, declaration_authority
)

practice_registration (
  id, practice_name, subscription_plan,
  provider_types[], user_id
)

verification_logs (
  id, patient_postcode, provider_type,
  verification_result, compliance_note,
  disaster_declarations
)
```

### API Architecture
```typescript
// RESTful Endpoints
GET  /api/disasters/postcode/{postcode}  // Public verification
POST /api/verifications/batch            // Practitioner bulk check
GET  /api/compliance/templates           // MBS note templates
POST /api/practice/register              // Practice onboarding
```

## Data Sources & Integration

### Government APIs
- **Federal**: disasterassist.gov.au (primary aggregator)
- **NSW**: nsw.gov.au/disaster-recovery (structured HTML tables)
- **QLD**: Queensland Reconstruction Authority
- **VIC**: Emergency Recovery Victoria
- **WA/SA/TAS/NT/ACT**: State emergency management portals

### Data Collection Strategy
- **Morning Sync**: 6 AM AEST - overnight declarations
- **Afternoon Sync**: 2 PM AEST - business hours updates  
- **Evening Sync**: 8 PM AEST - end-of-day declarations
- **Emergency Triggers**: Real-time monitoring for urgent updates

## Compliance Framework

### MBS Telehealth Requirements
- **Disaster Exemption**: Patients in declared areas can access telehealth without 12-month relationship
- **November 2025 NP Rules**: Enhanced compliance for Nurse Practitioners
- **Documentation Standards**: Automated generation of MBS-compliant notes

### Privacy & Security
- **Australian Privacy Act 1988** compliance
- **AES-256 encryption** for health data at rest
- **TLS 1.3** for data in transit
- **7-year retention** for clinical records
- **OAIC notification** procedures for data breaches

## Deployment Architecture

### Current Setup (Lovable + Supabase)
```yaml
Frontend: Lovable.dev managed hosting
Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (Sydney region)
Auth: Supabase Auth with RLS policies
Real-time: Supabase subscriptions
CDN: Global edge distribution
```

### Production Migration Plan (Vercel + Supabase)
```yaml
Frontend: Vercel (Sydney/Melbourne edges)
API: Vercel serverless functions
Database: Supabase Pro (Australian hosting)
Monitoring: Vercel Analytics + Sentry
Payments: Stripe with Australian tax compliance
```

## Monitoring & Performance

### Key Metrics
- **API Response Time**: <200ms P95 for disaster lookups
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% SLA target
- **Data Freshness**: <5 minutes from government declaration
- **Verification Accuracy**: >99.5% success rate

### Business Metrics
- **Monthly Verifications**: Tracking usage growth
- **Practitioner Adoption**: Registration and retention rates
- **Revenue per Customer**: Subscription tier optimization
- **Support Ticket Volume**: Platform usability metrics

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Government Website Changes**: Multi-source validation, manual override capabilities
- **Traffic Spikes**: Auto-scaling infrastructure, CDN caching
- **Data Quality**: Continuous validation, real-time monitoring

### Business Risks
