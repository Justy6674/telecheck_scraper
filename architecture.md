# TeleCheck - Production Architecture

## Platform Overview

**TeleCheck** (telecheck.com.au) is a production-ready SaaS platform providing real-time verification of Australian natural disaster zones for telehealth MBS exemptions. Healthcare practitioners can instantly verify if patients are located in government-declared disaster areas, removing the standard "established clinical relationship" requirement for telehealth services.

- **Professional Tier**: $149/month - 500 verifications, dashboard access, compliance notes
- **Enterprise Tier**: $399/month - High-volume APIs, practice management integration

### Current Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ **Completed Components**
- **Supabase Database**: Full PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies, real-time subscriptions
- **Authentication System**: Practice-focused registration with JWT tokens
- **Core Verification Engine**: Real-time postcode disaster lookup with MBS-compliant documentation
- **Medical UI/UX**: Healthcare-grade design system with accessibility compliance
- **Dashboard**: Real-time disaster monitoring, compliance tracking, usage analytics

#### üöß **In Development**
- **Government Data Integration**: Automated scraping from DisasterAssist.gov.au (760+ disasters)
- **Railway Scraper Service**: Daily Puppeteer scraping of all disaster pages
- **Complete LGA Extraction**: All affected areas with assistance program details
- **Practice Management APIs**: Integration with Medical Director, Best Practice, Cliniko

## Disaster Data Scraping System

### Railway Scraper Service (Puppeteer)
**Purpose**: Extract complete disaster data from DisasterAssist.gov.au

#### Data Extraction Process:
1. **Navigate** to disasters list (38+ pages)
2. **Click** into each disaster detail page (760+ disasters)
3. **Extract** comprehensive data:
   - All affected LGAs (not just one)
   - Assistance programs with varying coverage
   - Payment amounts and deadlines
   - Contact information
   - Full page content for audit

#### Extracted Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  agrn_reference: "AGRN-1216",
  event_name: "NSW Severe Weather Event",
  affected_areas: {
    all_lgas: ["Armidale", "Dungog", "Gunnedah", ...],
    all_lga_codes: ["11350", "12700", "13550", ...],
    assistance_programs: {
      agdrp: { lgas: [...], payment: {adult: 1000, child: 400} },
      dra: { lgas: [...], deadline: "2025-09-18" },
      loans: { primary_producer: 75000, small_business: 25000 }
    },
    full_page_text: "[Complete content for legal audit]"
  },
  source_url: "https://disasterassist.gov.au/...",
  verification_url: "https://disasterassist.gov.au/..."
}
```

### Practitioner Interface Output

**Input**: Patient Postcode (e.g., 2337)

**Output for ELIGIBLE**:
```
‚úÖ ELIGIBLE FOR TELEHEALTH
NSW Severe Weather Event (AGRN-1216)
Period: 31 July 2025 onwards
Affected LGA: Armidale

üìã Copy for Medicare:
"Patient in postcode 2337 (Armidale LGA) eligible for 
telehealth under disaster declaration AGRN-1216.
Verify: https://disasterassist.gov.au/..."

[Copy Text] [View Details] [Verify on DisasterAssist]
```

**Output for POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE (Practitioner Discretion)
Some areas of this LGA are affected.
Please verify specific address eligibility.
```

### Audit & Compliance
Every search stores:
- Practitioner ID
- Postcode searched
- Disasters returned
- Eligibility determined
- Verification URLs provided
- Timestamp and IP address
- Full disaster data snapshot

### Critical Requirements
1. **Accuracy**: Must extract ALL affected LGAs, not just primary
2. **Completeness**: Store entire page content for legal audit
3. **Verification**: Always provide direct DisasterAssist URL
4. **Currency**: Update daily via Railway scraper
5. **Compliance**: 7-year audit trail retention
