## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Legal & Clinical Framework

### 1. Legal Basis & Medicare Guidance
- Medicare explicitly ties telehealth disaster exemptions to **DisasterAssist.gov.au**
- States/territories announce activation but **DO NOT publish expiry dates**
- Only DisasterAssist records when a disaster is "ceased"
- This creates a grey zone requiring **professional judgement**

### 2. Professional Discretion & Documentation
**Practitioners must:**
- Cite DisasterAssist as the official reference
- Record AGRN, disaster title, and DisasterAssist link in patient records
- Document why telehealth access is in the patient's best interest
- Use professional judgement when expiry isn't clear

### 3. Patient-Centred Focus
- Purpose: Support patient access to care in exceptional circumstances
- Prioritise benefits over bureaucratic barriers
- Align with MBS telehealth spirit: supporting vulnerable patients in disasters

### 4. Source of Truth Hierarchy
1. **Primary:** DisasterAssist.gov.au (federal) - ONLY source for "ceased" status
2. **Supporting:** State/territory portals - activation details only
3. **Clinical:** Practitioner discretion with documented rationale

## 📋 Practitioner Note Templates

### Short Version
```
Patient resides in [LGA]. DisasterAssist.gov.au lists this LGA under disaster event [Title], AGRN [####], at [URL]. In line with DoH guidance and given the patient's needs, I exercised clinical judgement that telehealth access is appropriate and in the patient's best interest.
```

### Standard Version
```
Telehealth conducted under the MBS disaster exemption. The patient's location is [LGA], which is currently listed on DisasterAssist.gov.au ([Title], AGRN [####], [URL]). State/territory portals announce activation but seldom state expiry; the Commonwealth register is the only public indicator of current/ceased status. Considering clinical risk/benefit, barriers to timely care, and the patient's circumstances, telehealth is justified. Evidence archived.
```

### Formal Version
```
This consultation proceeds under the Medicare telehealth exemption for designated disaster areas. The patient resides in [LGA]; validation was performed against DisasterAssist.gov.au ([Title], AGRN [####], captured [timestamp AEST], [URL]). Where expiry is not explicitly published by state or territory authorities, DisasterAssist serves as the authoritative public indicator of current status. Exercising professional discretion and prioritising patient safety and access, I determined the health benefit outweighs administrative barriers. All verification artefacts (HTML, screenshot, hash) retained for audit.

## 🔄 Data Integrity & Crawl Schedule

### Crawl Cadence (AEST/Sydney)
- **Full crawl:** Monthly, 1st of month, 02:00 AEST
- **Open-only crawl:** Mon/Wed/Fri, 06:00 AEST  
- **Manual trigger:** Available in admin for emergencies

### Dual-Scraper Validation
- **Scraper A:** Playwright (primary/production)
- **Scraper B:** Puppeteer/Selenium (audit/validation)
- **Parity Gate:** Both must agree or status = NEEDS REVIEW

### Evidence Retention
- Full HTML snapshots
- Screenshots (PNG/PDF)
- SHA256 hashes
- 7+ year retention for Medicare/PSR audits

---

## ⚖️ Risk Mitigation
- **Legal:** Document DisasterAssist reference + professional rationale
- **Audit:** Retain crawl evidence, provide templates
- **Patient:** Ensure access isn't denied due to bureaucratic ambiguity
